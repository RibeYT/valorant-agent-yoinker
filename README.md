# How to Use
The program is very intuitive and all information will appear on the screen.
Here is a simple walkthrough.

## Region
When you open the program for the first time you'll need to enter your server region. [Here](https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055678634-Server-Select) is a list of server locations and their respective regions. You can change it anytime you want.

## Profile
After you enter your region, new options will appear on the screen.
These options allow you to create a profile, which is your preference for an agent in each map in a specific game mode. 

This allows you to create predefined combinations of agents-map-gamemodes to use during your playtime.

You can create, delete or select a profile from the main menu options

## Starting
After selecting the profile you want, the option to start the instalocker will appear. You will be prompted to start the Valorant before continuing with the instalocker. When your Valorant is opened, confirm the program and you can start looking for a match.

When the character selection starts your agent will already be selected.

# How it Works
Agent selecting is handled via the VALORANT Official API, which means that this program does not mess with the game's memory or files at all.

# Is This "bannable"?
**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

**No suspensions have been reported so far from using this program.**

This program **does not** use an auto-clicker, read the game's memory or files; therefore, the anti-cheat **should not** be triggered.

However, using the VALORANT API in this manner is against Riot's Terms of Service, since you are getting an advantage over other players. So there is always a risk.
